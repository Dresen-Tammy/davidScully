    <p>Prior to my current role at HP, I was the Global Creative Competency Manager,
      driving visual consistency across all product touch points and geographies.
      I also previously worked at Logoworks as the Director of Design, a design startup
      that was eventually acquired by Hewlett Packard. I also worked at Wild Graphics studios,
      and co-founded Glacier Marketing, an independent design and marketing studio, in&nbsp;2009.</p>
