    <p>I am a man of belief, family and passion. I am competitive in all aspects of my life, which has brought me to where I am today. I don't like to settle when better is achievable. I live for the details, and believe whole-heartedly that the last 10% is the most important. I still consider myself to be an artist, even though I have been in brand and digital design for decades. I love to draw and paint, however there is never enough time to actually do it.
    </p>
    <p>I simply love design, and in all humility, I am great at it. I love its ability to shape the decisions of users, to delight them, inform them, and to assist them. I look forward to hearing from you and starting our next great project together.</p>
